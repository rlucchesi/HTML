                <h2>Skills - Standard Practice in High-level Volleyball</h2>
                <p>Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of these skills comprises a number of specific techniques that have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball. <a href="#" id="moreskills">More</a></p>
                <div id="detailskills">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball, driving it to land inside the opponent's court. A serve is called an "ace" when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after an opponent being unable to handle it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pass:</strong> Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve, or any form of attack, making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set:</strong> The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the strategic player who decides which player will actually attack. The set is usually the second contact with the ball, putting it in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attack:</strong> or spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball. The object is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent's court and cannot be defended.</li>
                        <li><strong>Block:</strong> Three players performing a block, which is the action taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent's attack. The block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dig:</strong> is a much more reflex based skill, preventing the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground. A player may sometimes perform a "dive" (throw his or her body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball), and land on his or her chest. When the player also slides his or her hand under a ball that is almost touching the court, this is called a "pancake".</li>

                <h2>Strategy - Player Specialization</h2>
                <p>There are 5 positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level. Setter, Outside Hitter/Left Side Hitter, Middle Hitter, Opposite Hitter/Right Side Hitter and Libero/Defensive Specialist. Each of these positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match. <a href="#" id="morestrategy">More</a></p>
                <div id="detailstrategy">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setters:</strong> have the task for orchestrating the offense of the team. They have to be able to operate with the hitters, manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need to have swift and skillful appraisal and tactical accuracy, and must be quick at moving around the court.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liberos:</strong> ('free' in Italian) are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve. They are usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills. They do not necessarily need to be tall, as they never play at the net. The libero may not play other roles during that match, and wear a different color jersey than their teammates.</li>
                        <li><strong> Middle hitters</strong> are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter. They are specialized in blocking, since they must attempt to stop equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of the court.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outside hitters:</strong> attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets. Inaccurate first passes usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite.</li>
                        <li><strong>Opposite hitters:</strong> carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well formed block against the opponents' Outside Hitters and serve as a backup setter.</li>
                    </ul>
